### CoffeeTable

Coffee table is an online code editor, built mostly for fun, but also so that we can experiment with our crazy ideas on:
* TDD
* Static Code Analysis
* Git Workflows
* Collaboration
* Remote Pair Programming

A usable subset of VIM has been implemented. The code quality is generally okay, but badly in need of re-organization.

### To build and run
